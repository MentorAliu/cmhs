Car Management & History System


CMHS is a Car management system that helps RentACar and other Corporations manage their car stock, history and customers.

Technologies used in this project are ReactJS and Tailwindcss for frontend reason being as SPA applications has seen big improvements in performance and relatively easy to use for responsiveness and state management,
for Backend I started with Nodejs and Express for database Mongodb with Mongoose reason being performance,

While building this application challenges i faced are relatively small but somehow was always sceptical about database implementation between MongoDB and Mysql.
I'm leaving options available to refactor the application to Nextjs in the future and if the project gets bigger move to SQL database
